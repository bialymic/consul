# Gossip Encryption

This topics describes how to enable gossip encryption on a Consul datacenter.

<Note>

**WAN federated datacenters:** If using multiple WAN joined datacenters, be sure to use _the same encryption key_ in all datacenters.

## Enable gossip encryption


## Enable gossip encryption on a new datacenter


## Enable gossip encryption on an existing datacenter



Enabling gossip encryption only requires that you set an encryption key when
starting the Consul agent. The key can be set via the `encrypt` parameter.

~> **WAN Joined Datacenters Note:** If using multiple WAN joined datacenters, be sure to use _the same encryption key_ in all datacenters.

The key must be 32-bytes, Base64 encoded. As a convenience, Consul provides the
[`consul keygen`](/consul/commands/keygen) command to generate a
cryptographically suitable key:

```shell-session
$ consul keygen
pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s=
```

With that key, you can enable encryption on the agent. If encryption is enabled,
the output of [`consul agent`](/consul/commands/agent) will include "Encrypt: true":

```shell-session
$ cat encrypt.json
{"encrypt": "pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s="}

$ consul agent -data-dir=/tmp/consul -config-file=encrypt.json
==> WARNING: LAN keyring exists but -encrypt given, using keyring
==> WARNING: WAN keyring exists but -encrypt given, using keyring

         Node name: 'Armons-MacBook-Air.local'
        Datacenter: 'dc1'
            Server: false (bootstrap: false)
       Client Addr: 127.0.0.1 (HTTP: 8500, HTTPS: -1, DNS: 8600, RPC: 8400)
      Cluster Addr: 10.1.10.12 (LAN: 8301, WAN: 8302)

```

All nodes within a Consul cluster must share the same encryption key in
order to send and receive cluster information.

## Configuring Gossip Encryption on an existing cluster

As of version 0.8.4, Consul supports upshifting to encrypted gossip on a running cluster
through the following process. Review this [step-by-step tutorial](/consul/tutorials/security/gossip-encryption-secure?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs#enable-gossip-encryption-existing-cluster)
to encrypt gossip on an existing cluster.
