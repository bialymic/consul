# Gossip Encryption

This topics describes how to enable gossip encryption on a Consul datacenter.

<Note>

**WAN federated datacenters:** If using multiple WAN joined datacenters, be sure to use _the same encryption key_ in all datacenters.

</Note>

## Enable gossip encryption

We recommend enablying gossip erncryption to all new deployed Consul datacenters. 
If you have an existing datacenter running Consul `0.8.4` and above, it is possible to modify its configuration to support gossip encryption.

Below are listed the steps required for both scenarios:

- [Enable gossip encryption on a new datacenter](#enable-gossip-encryption-on-a-new-datacenter)
    1. Use `consul keygen` to generate a new gossip encryption key.
    1. Create a configuration file that includes the `encrypt` parameter set to the newly generated key.
    1. Distribute the configuration file to all the agent nodes that need to be pert of the datacenter.
    1. Start the Consul agent on all the nodes.
- [Enable gossip encryption on an existing datacenter](#enable-gossip-encryption-on-an-existing-datacenter)
    1. Use `consul keygen` to generate a new gossip encryption key.
    1. Create a configuration file that includes the `encrypt` parameter set to the newly generated key and `encrypt_verify_incoming` and `encrypt_verify_outgoing` set to `false`. 
    1. Distribute the configuration file to all the agent nodes that need to be pert of the datacenter.
    1. Perform a rolling restart of all the agents.
    1. Update the `encrypt_verify_outgoing` setting to `true` and perform a rolling restart of all the agents.
    1. Update the `encrypt_verify_incoming` setting to `true` and perform a rolling restart of all the agents.

## Enable gossip encryption on an existing datacenter



Enabling gossip encryption only requires that you set an encryption key when
starting the Consul agent. The key can be set via the `encrypt` parameter.

~> **WAN Joined Datacenters Note:** If using multiple WAN joined datacenters, be sure to use _the same encryption key_ in all datacenters.

The key must be 32-bytes, Base64 encoded. As a convenience, Consul provides the
[`consul keygen`](/consul/commands/keygen) command to generate a
cryptographically suitable key:

```shell-session
$ consul keygen
pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s=
```

With that key, you can enable encryption on the agent. If encryption is enabled,
the output of [`consul agent`](/consul/commands/agent) will include "Encrypt: true":

```shell-session
$ cat encrypt.json
{"encrypt": "pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s="}

$ consul agent -data-dir=/tmp/consul -config-file=encrypt.json
==> WARNING: LAN keyring exists but -encrypt given, using keyring
==> WARNING: WAN keyring exists but -encrypt given, using keyring
==> Starting Consul agent...
==> Starting Consul agent RPC...
==> Consul agent running!
         Node name: 'Armons-MacBook-Air.local'
        Datacenter: 'dc1'

       Client Addr: 127.0.0.1 (HTTP: 8500, HTTPS: -1, DNS: 8600, RPC: 8400)
      Cluster Addr: 10.1.10.12 (LAN: 8301, WAN: 8302)
    Gossip encrypt: true, RPC-TLS: false, TLS-Incoming: false

```

All nodes within a Consul cluster must share the same encryption key in
order to send and receive cluster information.

## Configuring Gossip Encryption on an existing cluster

As of version 0.8.4, Consul supports upshifting to encrypted gossip on a running cluster
through the following process. Review this [step-by-step tutorial](/consul/tutorials/security/gossip-encryption-secure?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs#enable-gossip-encryption-existing-cluster)
to encrypt gossip on an existing cluster.
